### hewwo, owo

I'm a 17 y.o. boi who likes to program in Kotlin, Dart (Flutter) and JavaScript. I also like to watch anime and make edits in After Effects.

##### What I'm working on?

- Podium: An unofficial Alles (Micro) client for Android
- [Backblur](https://github.com/idkwhatusernameuse/Backblur): An app to fit an image into a 1:1/16:9/9:16 container with a blurred background

##### How to reach me

- [Telegram](https://t.me/idkwhatusernameuse)
- Discord: idkwhatusernameuse#7097
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/idkwuu) (but if you're going to DM me, it'd be better if you do so through Telegram or Discord because Twitter DMs are horribly buggy)
